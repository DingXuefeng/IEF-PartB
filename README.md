This is a LaTeX template for the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowships application (H2020-MSCA-IF-2014).

Disclaimer: I do not offer any guarantees about this template. In particular, I cannot assure you that it fits the required guidelines (although I have tried to make it so).

New: the MC16 files were contributed by Liron Speyer as an adaptation of my
original template to the 2016 call. I've added them to this repository with
his permission.

Feel free to open a pull request if you would like to improve this template!
